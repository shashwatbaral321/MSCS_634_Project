# Clustering and Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **classification, clustering, and pattern mining** using a publicly available dataset. The analysis explores data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deriving meaningful insights that have practical relevance in real-world applications.  
The work also includes ethical considerations and recommendations for future use.

## 📊 Dataset Summary
- **Source**: Online dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (`Iris Dataset` for demonstration).  
- **Number of Records**: 150  
- **Number of Features**: 4 (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width)  
- **Target Variable**: Iris species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`)  

---

## 🛠️ Project Steps
### 1. Data Preparation
- Imported dataset using `pandas`.
- Checked for missing values (none found).
- Performed feature scaling for clustering algorithms.
- Split dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** for classification.

### 2. Clustering
- Implemented **K-Means** clustering.
- Visualized clusters using **2D scatter plots** (PCA-based dimensionality reduction).
- Compared results with true labels for evaluation.  

### 3. Classification
- Used **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models.
- Achieved **>95% accuracy** in predicting iris species.  
- Evaluated performance with **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.  

### 4. Pattern Mining
- Converted dataset into categorical bins for **Apriori algorithm**.
- Discovered frequent itemsets and association rules (e.g., "If Petal Length > 4.5, then likely Virginica").

## 🔑 Key Findings
- **Classification**: Random Forest achieved the best accuracy (>97%) compared to Logistic Regression.  
- **Clustering**: K-Means performed well with 3 clusters, aligning closely with actual species.  
- **Pattern Mining**: Simple and interpretable rules were discovered, enhancing explainability.  

---

## 🌍 Practical Relevance
- Classification models can be applied in **botany and agriculture** for automated plant species detection.  
- Clustering helps in **unsupervised grouping** of new data, useful for biodiversity studies.  
- Pattern mining enhances **decision-making** by uncovering hidden associations in datasets.  

---

## ⚠️ Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Dataset imbalance in some clusters.  
  - **Solution**: Used stratified sampling to maintain class distribution.  
- **Challenge**: Dimensionality in visualization.  
  - **Solution**: Applied **PCA** to reduce to 2 dimensions.  
- **Challenge**: Rule mining required categorical data.  
  - **Solution**: Performed binning of continuous features.  

---

## ✅ Ethical Considerations
- Dataset used is open-source and does not involve sensitive human data.  
- Models and rules should not be applied blindly in contexts where misclassification could cause harm.  
- Transparency and explainability were prioritized.  

---

## 📌 Recommendations
- Explore **deep learning approaches** (e.g., Neural Networks) for classification on larger datasets.  
- Extend clustering with **hierarchical clustering** for better interpretability.  
- Apply **advanced association mining** (FP-growth) on richer datasets.
